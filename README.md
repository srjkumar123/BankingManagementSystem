Banking Management System
This project is a Banking Management System built using Java, JDBC, MySQL, and Transaction Handling. The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing funds, and viewing transaction histories. The project showcases key concepts like transaction management, database connectivity, and proper exception handling in a real-world banking application.

View Balance: Retrieve and display current account balances.
Transaction History: Track and display transaction histories for each account.
Secure Transactions: Transactions are handled with robust error handling and proper rollback mechanisms.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for the backend logic.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): To interact with the MySQL database for performing SQL operations.
